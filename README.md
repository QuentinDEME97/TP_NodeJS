# TP_NodeJS
Repository for NodeJS classes

This simple code is a small chat app using Socket.io.
The interface is not perfect responsive, it is just a demo of what you can do with Socket.io.

# To launch 
Just type `node serverV2.js` in you terminal. 'server.js' is a simple server serving a simple html page on request.

Then go in your browser to `localhost:8080` and enjoy. You can use multiple tab to simulate multiple clients.
